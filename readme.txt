LocoAI – Chrome AI Auto Translator is a Chrome Extension and WordPress companion plugin that uses Google Chrome’s built-in Translator API to automatically translate plugin and theme strings directly in the browser — no paid API keys or external services required.

== Description ==

LocoAI – Chrome AI Auto Translator empowers WordPress developers and site owners to instantly translate any plugin or theme strings using Chrome’s built-in Translator API.  
It works as a browser-side Chrome Extension that communicates with the Loco Translate editor, enabling one-click translation of all language strings directly in the browser — fast, private, and cost-free.

This project is part of the *Google Chrome Built-in AI Challenge 2025* under the "Chrome Extension – Most Helpful" category.

= No Paid API Required – Unlimited Translations =

- Translate unlimited characters without any API key.
- Uses the Chrome Translator API, which operates locally through Chrome Translator API models.
- High-speed translation performance with up to 25,000 characters per minute.

== Problem Statement ==

Translating WordPress plugins and themes manually or through paid translation APIs (such as DeepL or Google Translate API) can be expensive and time-consuming.  
Most tools require:

== Solution ==

LocoAI leverages Chrome’s built-in AI Translator API, which runs locally in the browser, allowing:
- Secure and private in-browser translations
- No external API key or cloud dependency
- Instant, high-quality results
- Seamless integration with WordPress Loco Translate
